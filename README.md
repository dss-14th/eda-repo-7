### Trend Analysis about Rate of Cumulative Return by the Portfolios
* Backtest Result for the Traditional All-weather
- All_weather portfolio doesn't seem to be the best portfolio in terms of investment, since the rate of cumulative return is 170% over the last 25 years even though it's safer than any others. 
- Therefore, we think that it would be valuable to build a new portfolio that is able to make more returns as maintaining the safeness of All_Weather portfolio.

    3. 4,000,000 wons - 3,637 dollars
    4. impossible to buy more funds over 4,000,000 wons, and ignore the rest of investment money
